# VLQ-Deep-Learning-project
Codes and data for the VLQ research project, which corresponds to the paper: "Phenomenology at the Large Hadron Collider with Deep Learning: the case of vector-like quarks decaying to light jets" by myself and collaborators. arXiv:2204.12542 

--> ROOT-VLQ.ipynb: ROOT Analysis code. Takes the roots obtained in the MadGraph/Pythia8/Delphes chain as input, and outputs csv files with observables (pT, masses, MET, etc) and detector images in the .png format

--> Hybrid_net_Abstract_FullDataset.ipynb: Hybrid network codes. Also contains some additional stuff to make the significance and ROC plots
